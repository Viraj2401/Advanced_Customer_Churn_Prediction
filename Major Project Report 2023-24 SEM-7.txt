--SMOTE-ENN : Helps in overcoming classs imbalance which causes underfitting for the class with less data and causes overfitting for the class with majority data.

--Random Forest gave the best results as it uses ensemble learning learning methid as well as it is a bagging approach.

--SVM was used in the majority of the previous works done in the industry so we just didnt add it into our final applications for research.

--Applying PCA did not give very encouraging results so PCA was also not included.

--By doing EDA(Exploratory Data Analyis) we found the follwing insights:


	1.   Electronic check medium are the highest churners
	2.   Contract Type - Monthly customers are more likely to churn because of no contract terms, as they are free to go customers.
	3.   No Online security, No Tech Support category are high churners
	4.   Non senior Citizens are high churners

--Algorithms used are :

	Decision Trees
	Random Forest 
	PCA
	SMOTE-ENN

--PowerBI dashboard is also made for better analysis and understanding for the stakeholders

--XG Boost is implementation for next sem 
--Hyperplane Tuning will increase the accuracy and overcome
